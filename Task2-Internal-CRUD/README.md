# Task 2: Internal Business Automation (CRUD Application)

## Problem Statement

Managing learner enquiries manually can be time-consuming and error-prone for Iron Lady’s internal team.

## Proposed Solution

This task proposes a conceptual internal business automation system to manage learner enquiries efficiently.

The system is designed to support the following operations:

* Create new learner enquiries
* View all submitted enquiries
* Update enquiry status
* Delete resolved or invalid enquiries

## CRUD Design Overview

* Create: Add new learner enquiry records
* Read: Display all stored enquiries
* Update: Modify enquiry details or enquiry status
* Delete: Remove outdated or resolved enquiries

## AI Involvement (Future Scope)

AI can be integrated in the future to:

* Automatically categorize enquiries
* Detect duplicate or spam enquiries
* Prioritize leads based on urgency

## Impact

* Improved internal workflow efficiency
* Reduced manual tracking effort
* Better enquiry management and scalability
