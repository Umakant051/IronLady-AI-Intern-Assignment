# Task 1: AI-Based Customer Interaction Solution

## Problem Statement

Iron Lady users often have questions about programs, eligibility, enrollment process, and support.
Currently, resolving these queries manually can lead to delays and reduced user engagement.

## Proposed Solution

An AI-powered virtual assistant that helps users:

* Understand Iron Lady programs
* Check eligibility
* Learn about enrollment steps
* Get instant responses to common questions

## How AI Is Used

The solution uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and an AI language model to:

* Understand user queries
* Generate relevant, context-aware responses
  This improves customer experience and reduces manual support effort.

## Impact

* Faster response to user queries
* Improved learner engagement
* Reduced operational workload
